Authors Readme

#example
python authors.py -tr EnronDataset/train.txt -te EnronDataset/validation.txt

Weighting unigrams and bigrams equivalently

Note that the current classifyEmails function assumes that the test file provides
the authors which is will not in reality(test file is acting like validation at
the moment). We do get a nice error rate of only like 11% which we can tune
by varying the weighting between unigrams and bigrams
